# Surfs_up

For this analysis, temperature data for the months of June and December was investigated to identify temperature trends. The analysis could be used to determine whether an ice cream / surf shop could be be opened during these months. The technology used throughout this analysis was a SQLite database, VS Code, and Flask. 

## Analysis Results

The image below shows the descriptive statistics of temperature for the month of June. The data is sourced from the months of June over several years.

We have also added an image for the descriptive statistics of temperature for the month of December. Again this data is sourced from the months of December over several years.

Points to consider:
 - The Average temperatures for both months are very close: 74 for June and 71 for December. 
 - The maximum temperatures for both months are very close: 85 for June and 83 for December. 
 - Temperature in December seems to be more volatile than June

## Overall Summary

As our analysis shows, the average and max temperatures for June and December are very close. This shows that both months are suitable for running the surf shop. Additional reasearch items include: 
 - We can refactor the code to compare temperatures in the fall and spring to get an overall picture of temperature volatility for the full year. This can then be used to make a judgement on whether th shop should be a year-round or seasonal thing. 
 - We can also compare the descriptive statistics for precipitation with temperature for the the two months.
